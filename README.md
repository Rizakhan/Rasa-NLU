# Rasa-NLU
Interning for convergys as an R&amp;D intern My first job was to create a parser for a chatbot and then subsequently train it on my own training data and examples. I used rasa-nlu and core for this. Code can't be made available yet but these are some of the photos from the demo I presented to the senior architect of the company .
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic
